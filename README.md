# Fraction
A strategy game that builds completely on a cellular automata for all game logic, including AI's pathfinding, cloud movement, ground water propagation, water propagation, citybuilder AI, forest growth, electricity etc.
Comes with functioning multiplayer, which can be started by just opening http://91.203.212.130/Server.php in your browser and keeping it open, needs 2 clients to connect before you can play. Once you are connected you can place a base, the rest will only result in a construction site sign and will be constructed by your workers.
